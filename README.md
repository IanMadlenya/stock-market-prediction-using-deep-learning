## What is this project about?
This is a third-year project at the Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering at University College London (UCL), supervised by Dr Miguel Rodrigues, named "Stock Market Prediction Using Deep Learning Techniques".

* [My website about stock market & tweets] (https://zhedongzheng.github.io)

* Predictors

## How to run the code?
* To run all the code, you need to pre-install the following libraries in Python 3:
  * numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn (basic suite, most people already have)
  * [pandas-datareader] (https://github.com/pydata/pandas-datareader)
  * [opencv] (http://opencv.org/)
  * [python-twitter] (https://github.com/bear/python-twitter)
  * [tensorflow] (https://www.tensorflow.org/)
  * these libraries can all be easily installed through either `pip` or `conda`
* To run any code, you just need to download the folder "ucl-final-year-project", and cd into the folder, then run the code. For example, if you want to run `twi_sen_vs_price.py` in the folder `../ucl-final-year-project/plot`, this is an example of command line code (windows):
	
	```
	d:
	cd D:\morior-invictus\python-code\console\ucl-final-year-project\plot 
	python twi_sen_vs_price.py
	```
	Then you will see the result
